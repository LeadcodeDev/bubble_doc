# Bubble Documentation

## Motivation
There are a multitude of tools for designing documentation, such as [Undocs](https://undocs.pages.dev), [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and [Docs-boilerplate](https://github.com/dimerapp/docs-boilerplate) used for all Adonis packages.
The problem, with the exception of the Adonis boilerplate, is that they all use a frontend framework/library which, in my opinion, is not necessary for the design of documentation.

When we talk about documentation and thus a "content first" approach, we think directly of the [Astro] framework (https://astro.build/) which promises relatively efficient generation of static documents from markdown files; however, this tool is not designed to be used fully for project documentation.

This is why I decided to create Bubble, a tool for generating documentation from markdown files without the need to use a frontend framework.

### Choice of technologies

As a big fan of the Dart language, I decided to create Bubble using the Dart language in order to take advantage of its content generation speed during the build phase.

> Bubble can generate more pages than Astro ðŸ‘€
